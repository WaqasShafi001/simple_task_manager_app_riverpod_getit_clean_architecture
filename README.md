# Project Architecture and Design Decisions
# Introduction:
This document outlines the architectural decisions and design choices made during the development of Simple Task Manager Flutter App. It provides insight into the rationale behind these decisions and the assumptions guiding the development process.

# 1. Architecture:
* Clean Architecture: The app is structured according to Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns into layers: domain, data, and presentation. This promotes maintainability, scalability, and testability by enforcing a clear separation of concerns.
# 2. Dependency Injection:
* Get_it: Get_it was chosen for dependency injection due to its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use. It allows for the decoupling of components, facilitating easier testing and maintainability.
# 3. State Management:
* Riverpod: Riverpod is utilized for state management, offering a declarative and reactive approach to managing app state. It provides a clear separation between UI and business logic, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
# 4. Navigation:
* Auto_route: Auto_route is used for navigation, providing type-safe routing and code generation. It simplifies navigation management and reduces boilerplate code, ensuring a smoother navigation experience for users.
# 5. Assumptions:
* User Behavior: The app assumes typical user behavior, such as adding and deleting tasks, to inform UI/UX design decisions.
* Device Capabilities: Assumptions about device capabilities, like screen sizes, influence responsive UI layouts.
* External Dependencies: The app assumes reliable access to local storage (Hive database) for data management, reducing reliance on network connectivity and external APIs. 
# 6. Future Considerations:
* Scalability: The architecture allows for scalability to handle potential increases in user traffic and data volume.
* Performance Optimization: Efforts will be made to optimize app performance, focusing on reducing loading times and resource consumption.
* Adaptable Architecture: The architecture is flexible and can adapt to evolving requirements and changes in technology, ensuring the app remains relevant and up-to-date.
